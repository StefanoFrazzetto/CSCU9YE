## Greedy

    - [] 100 colours
    - [] 500 colours

## Hill Climbing

    - [] Indicate which neighbourhood was used
    - Plot values obtained while algorithm running (decreasing distance):
        - [] 100 colours
        - [] 500 colours
        - [] Running time for both

## Multi-Start HC
    - Running the algo 30 times, for both 100 and 500 colours subsets, calculate:
    - [] Mean
    - [] Median
    - [] Standard deviation

## Custom Algorithm

    - Running the algo 30 times, for both 100 and 500 colours subsets, calculate:
    - [] Mean
    - [] Median
    - [] Standard deviation
